# External AI Resources for Research

## 1. Overview
The global AI community provides a wide range of open tools, datasets, and learning resources that can accelerate research. This chapter focuses on **carefully selected, high-value resources** that are widely used, well maintained, and directly useful for academic research.

These resources are grouped by purpose: learning, datasets, modeling tools, compute, and software ecosystems.

### 2.7 Recommended Reading: Recent Research on AI in Science
The following papers are worth reading if you want a grounded view of where generative AI stands in research contexts. Both are recent enough to reflect the current state of the field.

Reddy, C. K., & Shojaee, P. (2025). *Towards Scientific Discovery with Generative AI: Progress, Opportunities, and Challenges*. This paper offers a broad and honest look at where generative AI is actually making a difference in scientific discovery and where the limitations remain.

Prathner, J., et al. *Beyond the Hype: A Comprehensive Review of Current Trends in Generative AI Research, Teaching Practices, and Tools*. A useful corrective to overblown claims, with practical relevance for researchers and educators alike.
