## 2. Campus AI Tools and Platforms

### 2.1 UMGPT
**UMGPT** is the university’s secure, institution-hosted large language model service.  
Researchers can use UMGPT for:
- Drafting and revising writing
- Summarizing literature and explaining concepts
- Code generation and debugging
- Secure LLM usage without external data sharing

### 2.2 Maizey (UM Generative AI Document Assistant)
Maizey allows researchers to upload documents and build custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems without writing code. Common use cases include literature review assistance, lab onboarding or SOP chatbots, course material Q&A bots, and policy and documentation summaries.

### 2.3 MIDAS AI Sandbox
The AI Sandbox provides researchers with curated examples of generative AI workflows, tools for evaluating LLM output, UM-approved AI resources, and best practices for responsible AI. The platform is updated as new institutional AI services come online.

## 3. High-Performance Computing Resources

### 3.1 Great Lakes Cluster
The **Great Lakes** cluster is U-M's primary HPC system for large-scale computing.

Great Lakes offers GPU and CPU nodes for ML training, a SLURM scheduler, pre-installed modules for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, and is well suited for AutoGluon training, deep learning, and large simulations.

**Link:** https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/

### 3.2 Armis2 (HIPAA-Aligned Secure HPC)
Armis2 supports computation involving sensitive or clinical data, including EHR, clinical research data, and restricted or HIPAA-aligned datasets. It includes GPU support for machine learning workflows.

**Link:** https://arc.umich.edu/armis2/

---

### 3.3 Lighthouse (Research Storage + HPC Integration)
Lighthouse provides large-scale research data storage with direct integration with HPC systems and shared data access for collaborative projects. It is especially useful for neuroimaging, high-density sensor data, and multimodal datasets.

**Link:** https://arc.umich.edu/lighthouse/

---

## 4. Data Access Resources

### 4.1 Michigan Medicine Synthetic Datasets
Michigan Medicine provides limited synthetic datasets for researchers to use without PHI exposure, including synthetic EHR and synthetic demographic and encounter data. These are useful for prototyping ML pipelines before IRB approval. Contact the Michigan Medicine data teams for access.

---

### 4.2 UM Library Data Services
The UM Library offers:
- A searchable **Data Catalog**
- Access to licensed datasets  
- Consultations for metadata, data management, and reproducibility  

The Library is especially valuable for social science, public policy, and health research.

---

### 4.3 ICPSR (Housed at UM)
UM is home to **ICPSR**, one of the world’s largest curated data archives.

Datasets include:
- Social sciences  
- Economics  
- Education  
- Public health  
- Behavioral science  

ICPSR datasets are cleaned, documented, and ideal for research and teaching.

## 5. Expert Consulting & Support Services

### 5.1 MIDAS Consulting
MIDAS provides free AI and data science consulting for UM researchers. Typical topics include machine learning and deep learning, feature engineering, model selection, responsible AI practices, and designing AI-enabled workflows.

**Link:** https://midas.umich.edu/consulting/

---

### 5.2 ARC Consulting (Advanced Research Computing)
ARC supports HPC onboarding, GPU access, SLURM scripting and job optimization, and data movement and storage workflows. They help researchers run AI workloads efficiently on UM's compute systems.

**Link:** https://arc.umich.edu/consulting/

---

### 5.3 Faculty-Student Research Connection
MIDAS runs a formal matchmaking program connecting faculty with graduate and undergraduate students who have data science and AI skills. The MIDAS Student Organizations Council represents more than 1,100 students across programs and student organizations, many of whom are actively looking to contribute to faculty research projects.

If you have a project ready for student involvement — whether standalone, part of a larger initiative, or a pilot — you can submit the details through MIDAS's Research Projects Collection Form. This is a genuinely underused resource that many faculty do not know exists (MIDAS, n.d.).

## 6. Training, Workshops, and Education

### 6.1 MIDAS Workshops
MIDAS regularly hosts workshops on topics such as introduction to machine learning, responsible AI, working with large language models, RAG and Maizey workflows, and using HPC for AI.

**Link:** https://midas.umich.edu/workshops/

---

### 6.2 MIDAS Generative AI Tutorial Series
MIDAS runs an ongoing tutorial series for researchers who want to learn when, why, and how to bring generative AI tools into their work. The 2025-2026 series is open to all UM researchers and requires no prior experience with generative AI. Sessions are held monthly, and recordings are made available afterward for those who cannot attend in person (MIDAS, n.d.).
