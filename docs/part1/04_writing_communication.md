# Writing and Communication with AI  
*A Practical Guide for Research Writing in the Age of Generative Models*

## 1. Introduction

Artificial intelligence has become a pervasive partner in the scholarly writing process. Yet its role is best understood not as a replacement for human authorship but as an amplifier of a researcher’s thinking, planning, and communication. AI tools provide scaffolding—helping researchers brainstorm ideas, experiment with narrative structures, check clarity, and iterate more quickly—while responsibility for accuracy, originality, and interpretation remains squarely with the human author.

Academic writing often follows a nonlinear path: ideas emerge, drafts evolve, arguments shift, and reviewers ask for clarifications. Generative AI can assist across the entire arc—from the earliest stage of identifying a research angle, to drafting sections, revising the logical flow, preparing figures, and translating material for broader audiences. When used thoughtfully, AI becomes a “writing lab partner,” accelerating exploration while preserving the researcher’s intellectual ownership.

## 2. Typical Use Cases

### Brainstorming titles, abstracts, and framing
Tools like ChatGPT or domain-specific systems (e.g., Maizey or NotebookLM) can generate variations of titles, refine abstract structures, and identify alternative framings. This helps overcome “blank page paralysis” and exposes different conceptual angles users may not have initially considered.

### Outlining logical flow and argument structure
AI can suggest narrative sequences, highlight missing transitions, or surface latent assumptions. For example, a researcher writing an introduction may ask AI to map out potential sub-sections or compare alternative logical progressions.

### Rewriting for clarity, tone, or conciseness
Editing assistance—clarifying sentence structure, reducing jargon, or tailoring tone to a grant proposal—is among the most mature and reliable applications of generative AI. Tools such as GrammarlyGO or Overleaf’s AI assistant can standardize style while maintaining the author’s conceptual intent.

### Translating or simplifying technical content
AI can help convert highly technical descriptions into plain-language explanations for interdisciplinary collaborators, patient-facing summaries, or media outreach. When translating between languages, however, authors must review carefully to ensure conceptual precision and avoid cultural or domain-specific misinterpretations.

### Generating visual summaries or diagrams
Some AI systems can produce conceptual diagrams, workflow figures, or graphical abstracts. While helpful for communication, these should be refined to ensure compliance with journal formatting and accessibility standards.

## 3. Good Practices for AI-Assisted Writing

### Maintain authorship and intellectual ownership
The researcher—not the AI—must remain the originator of ideas, claims, and interpretations. AI suggestions should be treated as drafts or prompts, not authoritative content.

### Verify sources, citations, and factual accuracy
Large language models may generate plausible but incorrect references (“hallucinations”). Authors should manually confirm every citation, data point, and factual claim. Several journals explicitly prohibit unverified AI-generated citations (e.g., Nature and Science policies).

### Document how AI was used
Many journals now request transparency statements describing whether AI contributed to brainstorming, drafting, editing, or summarizing. These statements ensure ethical disclosure while protecting author accountability.

### Avoid plagiarism and text recycling
Even when AI generates the wording, reusing text without disclosure can raise concerns about originality. Researchers should ensure that any AI-generated content is substantially revised and reflects their own intellectual contribution.

## 4. Institutional and Journal Guidelines

### University of Michigan guidance
UM’s Office of Research (UMOR) and the U-M Library have released ongoing guidance emphasizing:
- AI tools may be used for drafting and editing as long as authors maintain responsibility for accuracy and originality.
- Sensitive or proprietary data must not be uploaded into public AI tools unless approved.

### Examples from major journals

| Journal | Key Policy Points | Correct Source |
|:--------|:------------------|:---------------|
| **Nature** | AI tools cannot be listed as authors; authors remain accountable for content; AI-generated text must be disclosed; fabricated citations are prohibited. | [Springer Nature Editorial Policies (Nature Portfolio)](https://www.springernature.com/gp/policies/editorial-policies) |
| **Science** | Fully prohibits AI-generated text unless explicitly permitted; AI cannot be used to generate conclusions; no AI authorship. | [Science Editorial Policies](https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies) |
| **PLOS** | Allows AI for language editing; requires disclosure; prohibits AI-generated data or results without verification. | [PLOS Research Integrity and Publication Ethics](https://plos.org/research-integrity-and-ethics/) |
| **Elsevier** | Similar to COPE: AI cannot be listed as authors; use must be disclosed; authors remain responsible for accuracy. | [Elsevier Generative AI Policies for Journals](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/generative-ai-policies-for-journals) |

These policies converge on a common stance: AI may support writing but cannot take responsibility for scientific claims.

## 5. Tools and Examples

### ChatGPT, Maizey, Gemeni, NotebookLM
Useful for ideation, early drafting, and summarization. ChatGPT provides flexible conversational refinement; Maizey allows UM-hosted retrieval systems for course and research materials; NotebookLM offers document-grounded assistance.

### Editing Tools: GrammarlyGO, Wordtune, Overleaf Copilot
These systems excel in polishing prose—correcting grammar, aligning tone with academic norms, and improving readability.

### Reference Tools with AI Integration
- Zotero (reference manager) + Zotero Scholar Citations plugin
Note: Zotero itself is not an AI tool but integrates well with AI-powered systems and supports plugins that automate citation retrieval.
- Semantic Scholar (AI-powered recommendations and summaries)
- Scite.ai (citation verification and claim classification)

These tools address weak points of LLMs by grounding suggestions in verifiable metadata.

## 6. Reflection: Writing as a Dialogue with AI

Generative AI shifts writing from a solitary act to a dialogic one. Researchers increasingly engage in a back-and-forth with an intelligent assistant that surfaces alternatives, identifies gaps, and prompts deeper reasoning. This dialogical model encourages iteration and exploration while freeing cognitive bandwidth for higher-level conceptual work.

Yet the human researcher remains the ethical and intellectual center of the process. AI can amplify clarity, accelerate revisions, and democratize access to writing support, but it cannot judge scientific integrity, understand disciplinary nuance, or accept responsibility for the final scholarly product. Maintaining a strong personal voice and clear research perspective is essential.

Ultimately, AI-assisted writing is most powerful when treated as collaborative scaffolding: a system that helps the author think more clearly, communicate more effectively, and iterate more rapidly—without displacing the human insight that drives research.
