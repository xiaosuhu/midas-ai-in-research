## The Challenge

Early-stage research planning involves generating ideas, exploring possibilities, and structuring approaches—tasks that can benefit from AI's ability to surface connections and suggest alternatives, while requiring your domain expertise to evaluate quality.

## When AI Can Help

**AI is useful for research planning when:**
- Exploring a new research area and need to understand the landscape
- Brainstorming multiple approaches to a research question
- Identifying potential methodologies or frameworks
- Finding gaps in existing literature
- Structuring complex research workflows

## Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Define Your Research Domain

Start by clearly articulating your general research area and

 what you already know. This gives AI context to provide relevant suggestions.

### Step 2: Use AI for Divergent Exploration

Prompt AI to generate multiple angles, questions, and approaches. Treat this as brainstorming—quantity over quality initially.

### Step 3: Apply Your Expertise to Converge

Critically evaluate AI suggestions using your domain knowledge. Discard what doesn't fit, refine what shows promise.

### Step 4: Iterate and Refine

Use AI to elaborate on promising directions, identify potential challenges, and suggest resources.

## Validation & Quality Checks

**How to verify AI-generated research plans:**

1. **Domain fit**: Does this actually work in your field?
2. **Feasibility**: Can you execute this with available resources?
3. **Novelty**: Is this genuinely contributing something new?
4. **Rigor**: Does the approach meet methodological standards?

## Key Takeaways

- ✅ AI excels at generating alternatives and making connections
- ✅ Your domain expertise is essential for evaluation and refinement
- ✅ Use AI for divergent thinking, not final decision-making
- ✅ Always validate suggestions against field standards

## Try This

**Next time you start a new project:**
1. Write a brief description of your research interest
2. Ask AI to suggest 10 different research questions
3. Critically evaluate each one
4. Refine the most promising 2-3 with AI assistance
