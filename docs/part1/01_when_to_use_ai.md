## The Decision Framework

Not every research task benefits from AI. This chapter helps you make informed decisions about when AI will enhance your work versus when traditional methods are more appropriate.

## When AI Excels

**AI is particularly valuable for:**

- **Large-scale pattern recognition**: Analyzing thousands of research papers, identifying trends in big datasets
- **Routine, repetitive tasks**: Literature screening, data formatting, code documentation
- **Initial exploration**: Brainstorming research questions, generating multiple approaches
- **Rapid prototyping**: Quick data visualizations, preliminary analyses
- **Language tasks at scale**: Translation, summarization, style editing

## When to Skip AI

**Traditional methods are better when:**

- **Domain expertise is critical**: Novel research requiring deep contextual understanding
- **Sample size is small**: Limited data where human judgment and qualitative insight matter most
- **Stakes are very high**: Clinical decisions, legal interpretations, ethical determinations
- **Interpretability is required**: When you must explain every step of your reasoning
- **Resources are limited**: When AI tools require substantial compute or licensing costs

## The Human-AI Collaboration Spectrum

Most research should operate in the "AI-assisted" or "AI-augmented" zones, where you maintain control and understanding while AI handles scalable, repetitive elements.

## Decision Checklist

Before using AI for a research task, ask:

1. ✅ **Do I understand what the AI is doing?** If not, don't use it for critical tasks
2. ✅ **Can I validate the output?** If you can't check it, you shouldn't rely on it
3. ✅ **Is the task repetitive at scale?** This is where AI shines
4. ✅ **Do I have a backup plan?** Never let AI be a single point of failure
5. ✅ **Is this ethically appropriate?** Some tasks shouldn't be automated

## Key Takeaways

- 🎯 **AI is a tool, not a replacement** for domain expertise
- 🎯 **Start small**: Test AI on low-stakes tasks before critical work
- 🎯 **Always validate**: Your responsibility doesn't end when AI produces output
- 🎯 **Stay in control**: If you don't understand it, don't use it

## Try This

**Pick one research task you're currently doing manually.** Ask yourself:
1. Is it repetitive and scalable?
2. Can I easily verify the output?
3. Does it free up time for higher-value thinking?

If yes to all three, that's a great candidate for AI assistance.
