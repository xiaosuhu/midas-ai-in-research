A practical guide for researchers integrating AI tools into their work responsibly and effectively.

## A Practical Guide to AI-Augmented Research

This handbook is for researchers who want to bring AI into their work in a thoughtful, responsible way. Whether you are conducting literature reviews, preparing data, or writing grants, you will find practical guidance that treats AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for your own expertise and judgment.

This handbook is for you if you are a researcher, faculty member, or graduate student who wants to use AI tools effectively and responsibly. You do not need a deep technical background to get started, though the handbook also covers more advanced topics for those who want to go further.

What sets this handbook apart is its human-centered approach. We put domain knowledge first. We emphasize validation, reproducibility, and transparency at every step, and we are honest about what AI cannot do.

## How the Handbook Is Organized

The handbook follows the research lifecycle, from the earliest stage of framing a research question through data work, analysis, and finally sharing your findings. **You do not need to read it from beginning to end**. Each chapter is designed to stand on its own, so you can jump to whatever is most relevant to you right now.

Part I covers how AI fits into the broader research process, including literature review, writing, grant development, and ethics. Part II focuses on the hands-on side of data analysis, from accessing and preparing data to running models. Part III is a reference section with tools, resources, and templates you can put to use right away.

## The AI-Augmented Research Lifecycle

AI can play a useful role at many points in a research project, but knowing where and how to use it well requires some planning. The diagram below shows the nine phases of the research lifecycle as we think about it in this handbook. Each phase presents its own opportunities and its own considerations for working responsibly with AI.

The lifecycle starts with research design, where you think carefully about what questions AI can help you address and where your own judgment is irreplaceable. It moves through data access, preparation, and compute decisions, then into analysis at increasing levels of sophistication. The final phases focus on making sure your outputs are reproducible and well-documented, and on sharing your work with the broader community. The circled arrow back to phase one is intentional: good research is iterative, and what you learn along the way often reshapes how you think about the original question.

This handbook is a living document. The field of AI moves quickly, and we update the content regularly to reflect new tools, emerging practices, and lessons learned from researchers using this material in their own work. If you are returning after some time away, it is worth checking back — there is a good chance something new has been added since your last visit.

## Resources

The resources below were selected to give you a **broader picture of where AI in research** stands today and where it is heading. They pair well with the themes in this handbook, from understanding the overall landscape to thinking through the risks.

[Stanford HAI AI Index Report (2025)](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) is one of the most comprehensive annual overviews of AI progress, adoption, and societal impact. It is a good starting point if you want data-driven context for the conversations happening in your field.

[ExplanAItions 2025: The Evolution of AI in Research](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/about-us/ai-resources/ai-study/) is a recent study focused specifically on how researchers across disciplines are using AI today. It offers a grounded look at actual practices and what researchers say is working and what is not.

[University of Michigan: Going All-In on AI](https://research.umich.edu/research-stories/going-all-in-on-ai/) describes how U-M is approaching AI across its research enterprise. If you are working within the U-M ecosystem, this piece gives helpful context for the institutional direction and the kinds of support that are becoming available.

[Yale News: Doing More, Learning Less — The Risks of AI in Research](https://news.yale.edu/2024/03/07/doing-more-learning-less-risks-ai-research) offers a useful counterpoint. As AI tools make certain tasks faster and easier, there is a real question about whether researchers are developing the deeper understanding their work requires. This is worth reading alongside the more optimistic accounts.
