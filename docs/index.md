A practical guide for researchers integrating AI tools into their work responsibly and effectively.

## A Practical Guide to AI-Augmented Research

This handbook helps researchers across all disciplines integrate AI tools into their work responsibly and effectively. Whether you're conducting literature reviews, analyzing data, or writing grants, you'll find practical guidance on using AI as a research collaborator — not a replacement for domain expertise.

**Who this is for:**
- Researchers wanting to leverage AI tools in their workflow
- Faculty developing AI-assisted research methods
- Graduate students learning responsible AI practices
- Anyone seeking practical, validated approaches to AI in research

**What makes this different:**
This is a **human-centered, domain-expertise-first approach** to AI in research. We emphasize validation, reproducibility, and transparency — treating AI as a powerful collaborator that amplifies (never replaces) your research judgment.

## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is organized around the research lifecycle. You don't need to read it sequentially — jump to the chapter that addresses your current need:

- **Part I** covers AI across research activities (literature review, writing, ethics)
- **Part II** focuses on AI-assisted data analysis with hands-on examples
- **Part III** provides resources, tools, and templates to get started
