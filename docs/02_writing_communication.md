# Writing & Communication with AI


1. Introduction
Framing AI as a writing assistant rather than a replacement.
From idea to publication: where AI can help (planning, drafting, revising, translating, visualizing).

2. Typical Use Cases
Brainstorming titles and abstracts.
Outlining logical flow and argument structure.
Rewriting for clarity, tone, or conciseness.
Translating and simplifying technical language for public communication.
Generating visual summaries or diagrams.

3. Good Practices for AI-Assisted Writing
Maintaining authorship and intellectual ownership.
Verifying sources, citations, and factual accuracy.
Documenting when and how AI was used (transparency statements).
Avoiding plagiarism and text recycling.

4. Institutional and Journal Guidelines
U-M policy on AI use in writing (cite UMOR / Library guidance if available).
Examples from Nature, Science, PLOS, Elsevier: what’s allowed vs prohibited.

5. Tools and Examples
ChatGPT / Maizey / NotebookLM for idea generation.
GrammarlyGO, Wordtune, or Overleaf Copilot for editing.
Reference managers with AI integration (Zotero, Semantic Scholar).

6. Reflection: Writing as a Dialogue with AI
The evolving role of AI as a co-reader, co-editor, and co-teacher.
Maintaining a researcher’s voice and accountability.
