# Literature Review with AI

## PubMed vs “AI Deep Research”
- PubMed = curated bibliographic search
- AI synthesis = semantic reasoning + summarization
- Best practice: combine both, verify sources, cite papers not the model

## Practical workflow
1. PubMed for seed set → export citations
2. AI tool for summarizing themes → track prompts & outputs
3. Human verification → read key papers, extract quotes
