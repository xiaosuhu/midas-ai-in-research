AI accountability frameworks (ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF).
U-M ethics and compliance offices (Research Integrity, ITS, HITS).

6. Case Studies
Example of bias propagation (e.g., clinical AI misclassification).
Example of privacy leak from an LLM training corpus.

7. Practical Guidelines
Checklist for ethical AI use in research.
Documentation templates for AI tool use.

8. Reflection
