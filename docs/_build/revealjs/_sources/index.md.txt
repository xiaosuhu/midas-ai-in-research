## Welcome to the **MIDAS AI in Research Tutorial**.  

This handbook began with a simple curiosity — how do our questions as researchers evolve in the era of artificial intelligence? Each advance in AI reshapes not only *how* we analyze data or write code, but *what* we ask, *why* we ask it, and *how* we validate answers.  

## Our Mission
Through this living tutorial, I aim to gather and organize the essential **questions and answers** that researchers across disciplines face when integrating AI into their work — from literature review and grant writing, to ethical practice, reproducibility, and responsible deployment.  

## A Collaborative Resource
Rather than a static guide, this is an evolving space to **collect insights, examples, and reflections** about using AI as a true collaborator in research. Whether you are new to AI tools or looking to deepen your methodological understanding, I invite you to explore, question, and contribute to this shared resource.
