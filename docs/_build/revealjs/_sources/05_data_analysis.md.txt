# Data Analysis

## 1. Introduction

AI-Enhanced Data Analysis for Research.

Why AI-based tools are transforming data analysis.

The idea of “analysis as conversation” — using AI to explore data, build models, and iterate quickly.

Positioning your MIDAS interface as a practical, low-barrier way for UM researchers to start.


## 2. Overview of the MIDAS Data Analysis Interface

What the interface does and what problems it solves.

Who it is designed for (researchers who don’t want to code from scratch / domain experts exploring models).

### 2.1 Workflow summary
Upload data → explore → preprocess → model → evaluate → export results

### 2.2 Key Features

- Support for tabular datasets (CSV, Excel)
- Automatic preprocessing, missing value handling, and feature engineering
- Access to classical ML + AutoGluon deep learning models
- Alignment with U-M privacy policy (no PHI uploads)
- Exportable results, plots, and reproducible scripts


## 3. Public Data Resources

### 3.1 University of Michigan Sources
- U-M Library data catalog  
- ICPSR  
- Michigan Medicine synthetic datasets  
- MIDAS curated datasets  

### 3.2 National / Global Public Datasets
- Kaggle

- RMSE, MAE  
- MAPE, MASE  

### 6.2 Interpretation Tools
- Feature importance  
- PDP plots  
- Error analysis  

### 6.3 Exporting Outputs
